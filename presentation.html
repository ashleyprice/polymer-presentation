						Polymer: Everything is elements<br>
						Polymer is a low level UI library that makes building apps easier.<br>
						Polymer is a LIBRARY not a FRAMEWORK.<br>
						They consider the DOM the framework.<br>
						Return to early days of HTML: UI is made in HTML and manipulated using DOM APIs<br>
						Polymer team is part of the chrome team. In the past, building frameworks that are above the platform (use the web platform as a rendering layer).

					What is Polymer
				</section>
				<section>
					<aside class="notes">
						Polymer is a web platform thing (not a chrome thing). Web components are a new standard. 
					</aside>
					Polymer is built on Web Components
				</section>
				<section>
					Composable with Shadow DOM.
					Consumable with HTML 
				</section>
				<section>
					<aside class="notes">
						Polyfills aren't polymer. They're written by the polymer team to let polymer apps run on other recent browsers.
					</aside>
					Polyfills lets this work across a number of browsers
				</section>
				<section>
						Polymer is a thin layer on top of web components. Web components are primative types. Polymer (1) Reduce boilerplate (2) Introduces a declarative syntax

					Leveraging Polymer
				</section>
				<section>
					Polymer has a set of Core Elements.
					Pull down the code for the element you want and import it
					<pre><code>
<link rel="import" href="my-button.html">
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					Defining &amp; Composing custom elements super easy: <br>
					template will capture the element's "view"
					put a style in the template
					template is rendered in the Shadow DOM hidden from other elements stopping style code from leaking into other areas of your DOM.
					Add a script 
					Polymer comes with two way data binding with mustache syntax.
					Polymer comes with event binding.
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				What Polymer is good for: 
				Building apps made of elements.
				Building elements out of elements
				Building sets of elements to pass around to folks

					Material Design
				</section>
				<section>
					<aside class="notes">
						Material design is a unified system of visual, motion, and interaction design that adapts across different devices. Material design is inspired by tactile materials, such as paper and ink. Material surfaces interact in a shared space. Surfaces can have elevation (z-height) and cast shadows on other surfaces to convey relationships.
					</aside>
					What is Material Design?

				<section>
					Examples
				</section>
				<section>
					<aside notes="class">
						Upon receiving an input event, the system provides an instantaneous visual confirmation at the point of contact: under the pad of a finger for touch, at the mic for voice, or in the appropriate field for a keyboard press. One way to express this acknowledgment is through the ink metaphor, the dynamic display surface that coats every sheet of paper.

				</section>
				<section>
				<section>
					<aside notes="class">
						In addition to ink-like actions on the surface, the material itself can also respond to interaction. The material can lift up when touched or clicked, indicating an active state. The user can generate new or transform existing material upon touch or click, or directly manipulate sheets of material, dragging or flinging them.

					<aside notes="class">
						When building a transition, consider both the order in which elements move and the timing of their movement. Ensure that motion supports the information hierarchy; that is, it conveys to the user what content is most important by creating a path for the eye to follow.

					<aside class="notes">
						In material design, every pixel drawn by an application resides on a sheet of paper. Paper has a flat background color and can be sized to serve a variety of purposes. A typical layout is composed of multiple sheets of paper.

	  					The system may draw pixels for elements such as status or system bars, which don’t reside on paper. It’s helpful to think of such system elements as being printed on the back side of the display’s glass, on a surface that is separate from the app content beneath.
