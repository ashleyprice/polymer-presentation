						Polymer: Everything is elements<br>
						Polymer is a low level UI library that makes building apps easier.<br>
						Polymer is a LIBRARY not a FRAMEWORK.<br>
						They consider the DOM the framework.<br>
						Return to early days of HTML: UI is made in HTML and manipulated using DOM APIs<br>
						Polymer team is part of the chrome team. In the past, building frameworks that are above the platform (use the web platform as a rendering layer).

				<section>
					<aside class="notes">
					Polymer is a web platform thing (not a chrome thing). Web components are a new standard. <br>
					Web Component: they allow us to bundle markup and styles into custom HTML elements<br>
					working their way through the W3C and landing in browsers as we speak<br>
					native Web Components I'd recommend using Chrome Canary, since it has the best support
					</aside>
					Polymer is built on Web Components
				</section>

					<aside class="notes">
						Polymer (1) Reduce boilerplate (2) Introduces a declarative syntax 
					</aside>
				<p>We can think of web components as primative types.</p>
				<p>Polymer is a thin layer on top of web components.</p>

						Shadow DOM is designed to provide encapsulation by hiding DOM subtrees under shadow roots. It provides a method of establishing and maintaining functional boundaries between DOM trees and how these trees interact with each other within a document, thus enabling better functional encapsulation within the DOM.
					</aside>
					Composable with Shadow DOM.<br>
					Consumable with HTML

					<aside class="notes">
						Polyfills aren't polymer. They're written by the polymer team to let polymer apps run on other recent browsers.<br>
						 I wanted a word that meant “replicate an API using JavaScript (or Flash or whatever) if the browser doesn’t have it natively”.

					<h3>Polyfills</h3>
					Make it work in the browser of your choice

					<h3>Leveraging Polymer</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Core Elements</h3>
					<p>Polymer has a set of <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/components/core-elements/demo.html#core-toolbar">Core Elements</a></p>
					Pull down the code for the element you want and import it
					<pre><code>
<link rel="import" href="poly-toolbar.html">
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
				<h3>Custom Elements</h3>
					Defining &amp; Composing custom elements super easy
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>See it</h3>
					template will capture the element's "view"
					put a style in the template
					template is rendered in the Shadow DOM hidden from other elements stopping style code from leaking into other areas of your DOM.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Do things</h3>
					Add a script 
					Polymer comes with two way data binding with mustache syntax.
					Polymer comes with event binding.
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>So what Polymer is good for?</h3>
				<p>Building apps made of elements.</p>
				<p>Building elements out of elements.</p>
				<p>Building sets of elements to pass around to folks.</p>

					<h2>Material Design</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<aside class="notes">
						Material design is a unified system of visual, motion, and interaction design that adapts across different devices. Material design is inspired by tactile materials, such as paper and ink. Material surfaces interact in a shared space. Surfaces can have elevation (z-height) and cast shadows on other surfaces to convey relationships.
					</aside>
					What is Material Design?

				<section>
					Examples
				</section>
				<section>
					<aside notes="class">
						Upon receiving an input event, the system provides an instantaneous visual confirmation at the point of contact: under the pad of a finger for touch, at the mic for voice, or in the appropriate field for a keyboard press. One way to express this acknowledgment is through the ink metaphor, the dynamic display surface that coats every sheet of paper.

				</section>
				<section>
					<aside notes="class">
						In addition to ink-like actions on the surface, the material itself can also respond to interaction. The material can lift up when touched or clicked, indicating an active state. The user can generate new or transform existing material upon touch or click, or directly manipulate sheets of material, dragging or flinging them.

					<aside notes="class">
						When building a transition, consider both the order in which elements move and the timing of their movement. Ensure that motion supports the information hierarchy; that is, it conveys to the user what content is most important by creating a path for the eye to follow.

					<aside class="notes">
						In material design, every pixel drawn by an application resides on a sheet of paper. Paper has a flat background color and can be sized to serve a variety of purposes. A typical layout is composed of multiple sheets of paper.

	  					The system may draw pixels for elements such as status or system bars, which don’t reside on paper. It’s helpful to think of such system elements as being printed on the back side of the display’s glass, on a surface that is separate from the app content beneath.
